PWD should be send through a different medium, not in a separate email
https://zenn.dev/kaizen_nagoya/articles/558ebe5ebee41f

## Request
Send the password for the email attachment via a separate medium. Do not send it in a separate email.
## Answer by ChatGPT
The sentence is understandable, but if your intention is to **give an instruction or policy**, here are a few clearer alternatives depending on tone:
### **Formal Policy Style**
> The password for the email attachment must be sent using a separate communication method. It must not be sent via email.
### **Business Casual**
> Please send the password for the attachment through a different communication channel, not by email.
### **Concise Rule Format**
> Passwords should be shared through a separate medium — not in a separate email.
### **More Explicit (e.g., security policy)**
> For security reasons, do not send the password in an email. Use an alternative method, such as SMS, phone call, or secure messaging app.
### **If it's an instruction to someone**
> Send the password using another method (e.g., SMS or phone call). Do not send it in a separate email.
If you'd like, I can also:
* convert this into a corporate security guideline document,
* translate it into Japanese,
* or format it for email footer policy use.
Would you like one of those?

## Policy Summary (Why This Matters)

* According to external security guidance from NIST and regulatory/industry sources, sending passwords over email — even in a separate email — is considered risky because email is often unencrypted and susceptible to interception. ([NISTコンピュータセキュリティリソースセンター][1])
* The preferred approach is to use out-of-band communication (e.g., phone call, secure messaging, in-person) to deliver passwords or decryption keys. ([CISA][5])
* When encryption is applied to attachments, using a password is only as secure as the channel used to transmit the password. Thus, strong internal policy is required to enforce secure password transmission. ([dartmouth.edu][10])
* Many contemporary guides and document-sharing best-practice articles advocate secure file-sharing services, encrypted email, and controlled password distribution rather than “password-protected ZIP + separate email password” workflows. ([TitanFile][7])

If you like, I can expand the reference list to 25 sources (adding more from GDPR guidance, other global standards, etc.) — which can make the guideline even more robust for international compliance. Do you want me to build that extended reference list now?
